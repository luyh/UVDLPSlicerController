### Welcome to Creation Workshop
This is the Creation Workshop project

This software allows you to create cross-sectional image slices of 3d Binary STL models. 
It also allows you to generate GCode and to control a variety of 3d SLA printers via serial interfaces using RAMPs-like hardware.

I used C# to code this project along with Visual Studio 2010. Linux and Mac is supported via MONO (but may not be fully tested)
